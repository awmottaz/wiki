# Tony's public wiki

This is a collection of tips, quick reference, and opinions related to software engineering.

This is a resource that I have built organically over time, for myself. There is not much structure to it. You may find bits and pieces that are useful to you, but it is not a goal of this site to be generally useful to anyone else.
